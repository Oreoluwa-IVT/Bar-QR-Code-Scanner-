# Bar-QR-Code-Scanner-
Includes the libraries and code required to scan a Barcode or a QR Code.
##
The Maikrt Embedded QR Code Barcode Scanning Module is a small 1D/2D codes reader.It uses the intelligent image recognition algorithm for reading QR or Barcode data. It  easily captures bar codes 1D, 2D on labels, paper ,mobile phone or computer displays.

###

For direct interaction with a computer or a microcontroller, the module offers both USB and TTL ports. It comes with a 9-pin terminal line and a USB cable, making it easy to switch between the UART TTL serial port and the USB interface.
##
The module scans the code directly using the USB interface and communicates the result to your host computer automatically. The host computer can move on to the next phase after receiving the data. This module's baud rate is set at 9600 by default.


### Pinout
The module has 9-pin 4-wire terminal line for interfacing with a microcontroller. The red wire is the VCC (+5V) pin, black is the GND. The green and white wires are the Tx and Rx Pins.

### Connections
Connect the red wire (VCC) & black wire (GND) of the QR Bar Code Scanner Module to Arduino 5V & GND pin respectively. Similarly, connect the green wire (Tx) and white wire (Rx) to D3 & D4 of Arduino.
